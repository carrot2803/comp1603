## Why do some solutions use recursion extensively?
Many students struggle with recursion, so some solutions were designed to be recursive to help improve their understanding and mastery of this concept.

# What are the "new", "boolalpha" and other functions used for in some of the solutions?

These functions are not directly related to the problems being solved and are used to generate sample outputs in the main function. <br/>

The "new" keyword is used to dynamically allocate memory for nodes in linked lists, while the "boolalpha" function is used to print Boolean values as "true" or "false". <br/>

These functions are not covered in the course syllabus but are useful for convenient sample outputs.
